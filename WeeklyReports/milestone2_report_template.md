## About this Milestone 

Currently we have all the technology and basic project scope defined. Design and development are working in parallel, with the basic game mechanics and game structure in construction and the visual tone, UI and assets being created.

## Questions to Answer for Milestone 2
### Do you have your technologies/SDKs researched? 

List technologies here as well as anything requires further research:

* Unity: Version 3.11
* Vuforia
* Figma & Illustrator
* Mobile devices
* Physical Target Images

### What is the vision for the application you are committing to for the next milestone?
By the next milestone we will have a basic playable level including card placement, the drone attack phase, and a win/loss ending.
Level select, card upgrades, and additional UI are not in scope for this coming milestone.

### Do you have a workflow in place? 
Currently the three weekly standups serve as a check in where design can run the UI by the development team, potential sounds are evaluated, and the development team discusses in-progress and needed scripts/code. Issues are tracked inside the github project and we have a slack and facebook chat for any additional communications.

### Do you have a common project started?
Yes

### Do you have major blocking issues at this time? 
No

### How will you be employing sound? 
There will be diegetic sounds to immerse the player in the battle scenes. Turret shooting, drone shooting and drone damage will be accompanied by sound effects. For non-diegetic sounds, there wil be a background track for each stage.
